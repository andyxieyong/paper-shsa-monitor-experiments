# Experiments for SASO 2019

This repository contains experiments to [shsa-prolog] for the [SASO 2019](https://saso2019.cs.umu.se/) paper:
*"Fault Detection exploiting Implicit Redundancy with Uncertainties in Space and Time"*

This is a ROS package that needs our robot [Daisy] to run the [launch files](./launch/README.md).
However, for the experiments on fault detection,
see the log files (csv) and scripts in [experiments](./experiments/README.md).
